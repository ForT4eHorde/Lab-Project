# Lab-Project 1
A project that shows some point manipulation on a plane. Showing off my OOP skills

The main task was:
  Create a class for working with points in the plane. The point coordinates are Cartesian. Implement methods:  
  - moving the point;
  - Determining the distance to the origin of the coordinates.
  
Requirements for the project:
  - To demonstrate this, it is mandatory to write a main function. It is a must to demonstrate the different ways of creating objects
    of the base class (all kinds of constructors). The program has to demonstrate the use of all methods. 
  - In addition to the operations specified in the individual assignment, the base class must implement general methods:
      - initialization;
      - keyboard input (overloading of initialization, the initialization method called without arguments, requests data from the user);
      - displaying the state of all attributes of the class.
     (Explanation: main should not contain stream input and output operators.)
  - Create a base class with closed fields, where operations are implemented as class methods.
  - Encapsulate all attributes of the base class in a separate class. Ð’ The base class should have only one data field, represented by an object of of the attribute         class (aggregation).
  - Provide the attributes class with an initialization constructor, overload input/output operations for it as external friendly functions.
  - In a base class, implement a constructor with an initialization list and default values (one or more) and a constructor without arguments (initialization method         call).
  - The operations specified in the individual task can be implemented by overloading of the corresponding operators. First of all they are implemented as class methods.     If it is not possible to implement through a method, then as external friendly functions (the impossibility must be explained).
  - The class interface and implementation must be separated and put into separate files, outside the file with the main function.
